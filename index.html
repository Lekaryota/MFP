    <h1>DARPA</h1>
    <p>
      The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and
      development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible
      for the development of emerging technologies for use by the
      military.[3][4] Originally known as the Advanced Research Projects Agency
      (ARPA), the agency was created on February 7, 1958, by President Dwight D.
      Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 (Russian:
      <span>Спутник 1</span>) in 1957. By collaborating with academia, industry,
      and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and
      development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science,
      often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements.[5] The name of the
      organization first changed from its founding name, ARPA, to DARPA, in
      March 1972, changing back to ARPA in February 1993, then reverted to DARPA
      in March 1996.[6]

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    As of 2021, their mission statement is "to make pivotal investments in
    breakthrough technologies for national security".[10]
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Early history (1958–1969)</h3>
    <p>
      The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was suggested by the
      President's Scientific Advisory Committee to President Dwight D.
      Eisenhower in a meeting called after the launch of Sputnik.[11] ARPA was
      formally authorized by President Eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of
      forming and executing research and development projects to expand the
      frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond
      immediate military requirements.[5] The two relevant acts are the
      Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)[12] (Public
      Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958.
      It was placed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and
      counted approximately 150 people.[13] Its creation was directly attributed
      to the launching of Sputnik and to U.S. realization that the Soviet Union
      had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial
      funding of ARPA was $520 million.[14] ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson,
      left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at
      ARPA.[15] Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was
      hired as his scientific assistant.[16]
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson and York were both keen on space projects, but when NASA was
      established later in 1958 all space projects and most of ARPA's funding
      were transferred to it. Johnson resigned and ARPA was repurposed to do
      "high-risk", "high-gain", "far out" basic research, a posture that was
      enthusiastically embraced by the nation's scientists and research
      universities.[17] ARPA's second director was Brigadier General Austin W.
      Betts, who resigned in early 1961 and was succeeded by Jack Ruina who
      served until 1963.[18] Ruina, the first scientist to administer ARPA,
      managed to raise its budget to $250 million.[19] It was Ruina who hired J.
      C. R. Licklider as the first administrator of the Information Processing
      Techniques Office, which played a vital role in creation of ARPANET, the
      basis for the future Internet.[20]
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the political and defense communities recognized the need
      for a high-level Department of Defense organization to formulate and
      execute R&D projects that would expand the frontiers of technology beyond
      the immediate and specific requirements of the Military Services and their
      laboratories. In pursuit of this mission, DARPA has developed and
      transferred technology programs encompassing a wide range of scientific
      disciplines that address the full spectrum of national security needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1958 to 1965, ARPA's emphasis centered on major national issues,
      including space, ballistic missile defense, and nuclear test
      detection.[21] During 1960, all of its civilian space programs were
      transferred to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
      and the military space programs to the individual services.[22]
    </p>
    <p>
      This allowed ARPA to concentrate its efforts on the Project Defender
      (defense against ballistic missiles), Project Vela (nuclear test
      detection), and Project AGILE (counterinsurgency R&D) programs, and to
      begin work on computer processing, behavioral sciences, and materials
      sciences. The DEFENDER and AGILE programs formed the foundation of DARPA
      sensor, surveillance, and directed energy R&D, particularly in the study
      of radar, infrared sensing, and x-ray/gamma ray detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      ARPA at this point (1959) played an early role in Transit (also called
      NavSat) a predecessor to the Global Positioning System (GPS).[23]
      "Fast-forward to 1959 when a joint effort between DARPA and the Johns
      Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory began to fine-tune the early explorers'
      discoveries. TRANSIT, sponsored by the Navy and developed under the
      leadership of Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite
      positioning system."[24][25]
    </p>
    <p>
      During the late 1960s, with the transfer of these mature programs to the
      Services, ARPA redefined its role and concentrated on a diverse set of
      relatively small, essentially exploratory research programs. The agency
      was renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1972,
      and during the early 1970s, it emphasized direct energy programs,
      information processing, and tactical technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning information processing, DARPA made great progress, initially
      through its support of the development of time-sharing. All modern
      operating systems rely on concepts invented for the Multics system,
      developed by a cooperation among Bell Labs, General Electric and MIT,
      which DARPA supported by funding Project MAC at MIT with an initial
      two-million-dollar grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      DARPA supported the evolution of the ARPANET (the first wide-area packet
      switching network), Packet Radio Network, Packet Satellite Network and
      ultimately, the Internet and research in the artificial intelligence
      fields of speech recognition and signal processing, including parts of
      Shakey the robot.[27] DARPA also supported the early development of both
      hypertext and hypermedia. DARPA funded one of the first two hypertext
      systems, Douglas Engelbart's NLS computer system, as well as The Mother of
      All Demos. DARPA later funded the development of the Aspen Movie Map,
      which is generally seen as the first hypermedia system and an important
      precursor of virtual reality.
