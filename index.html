    <h1>DARPA</h1>
    <p>
      The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and
      development agency of the Unitedf States Department of Defense responsible
      for the development of emerging technologies for use by the
      military.[3][4] Originally known as the Advanfced Research Projects Agency
      (ARPA), the agency was created on February 7, 1958, by President Dwight D.
      Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 (Russian:
      <span>Спутник 1</span>) in 1957. By collaborating with academia, industry,
      and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and
      development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science,
      often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements.[5] The name of the
      organization first changed from its founding name, ARPA, to DARPA, in
      March 1972, changing back to ARPA in February 1993, then reverted to DARPA
      in March 1996.[6]

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    As of 2021, their mission statement is "to make pivotal investments in
    breakthrough technologies for national security".[10]
    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Early history (1958–1969)</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="bold-text">The Advanced Research Projects Agency</span> (ARPA) was suggested by the
      President's Scientific Advisory Committee to President Dwight D.
      Eisenhower in a meeting called after the launch of Sputnik.[11] ARPA was
      formally authorized by President Eisenhower in 1958 for the purpose of
      forming and executing research and development projects to expand the
      frontiers of technology and science, and able to reach far beyond
      immediate military requirements.[5] The two relevant acts are the
      Supplemental Military Construction Authorization (Air Force)[12] (Public
      Law 85-325) and Department of Defense Directive 5105.15, in February 1958.
      It was placed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and
      counted approximately 150 people.[13] Its creation was directly attributed
      to the launching of Sputnik and to U.S. realization that the Soviet Union
      had developed the capacity to rapidly exploit military technology. Initial
      funding of ARPA was $520 million.[14] ARPA's first director, Roy Johnson,
      left a $160,000 management job at General Electric for an $18,000 job at
      ARPA.[15] Herbert York from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was
      hired as his scientific assistant.[16]
